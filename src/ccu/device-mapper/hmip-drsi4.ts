/**
 * Device mapper for HmIP-DRSI4 (DIN Rail Switch Interface, 4 channels) and related
 * multi-channel switch actuators (HmIP-DRSI1).
 *
 * **Multi-endpoint pattern** — this mapper is the canonical example for producing more than
 * one `MappedDeviceEndpoint` from a single physical device. The HmIP-DRSI4 exposes four
 * independent output channels, each of which becomes its own Matter on/off device.
 *
 * ## Real HmIP-DRSI4 channel structure
 *
 * ```
 * ch0   MAINTENANCE                        — housekeeping (not exposed)
 * ch1   MULTI_MODE_INPUT_TRANSMITTER       — input button 1 (SENDER)
 * ch2   MULTI_MODE_INPUT_TRANSMITTER       — input button 2 (SENDER)
 * ch3   MULTI_MODE_INPUT_TRANSMITTER       — input button 3 (SENDER)
 * ch4   MULTI_MODE_INPUT_TRANSMITTER       — input button 4 (SENDER)
 * ch5   SWITCH_TRANSMITTER                 — output 1 physical relay state (NONE)
 * ch6   SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 1 control ch, 1st VR (RECEIVER) ← used
 * ch7   SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 1 control ch, 2nd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch8   SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 1 control ch, 3rd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch9   SWITCH_TRANSMITTER                 — output 2 physical relay state (NONE)
 * ch10  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 2 control ch, 1st VR (RECEIVER) ← used
 * ch11  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 2 control ch, 2nd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch12  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 2 control ch, 3rd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch13  SWITCH_TRANSMITTER                 — output 3 physical relay state (NONE)
 * ch14  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 3 control ch, 1st VR (RECEIVER) ← used
 * ch15  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 3 control ch, 2nd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch16  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 3 control ch, 3rd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch17  SWITCH_TRANSMITTER                 — output 4 physical relay state (NONE)
 * ch18  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 4 control ch, 1st VR (RECEIVER) ← used
 * ch19  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 4 control ch, 2nd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch20  SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER            — output 4 control ch, 3rd VR (RECEIVER)
 * ch21  SWITCH_WEEK_PROFILE                — weekly timer profile (not exposed)
 * ```
 *
 * Each output has exactly one `SWITCH_TRANSMITTER` (reports the physical relay state) followed
 * by three `SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER` channels (the addressable control endpoints). We pair each
 * transmitter with the first virtual receiver that follows it — that channel carries the
 * user-assigned name (e.g. "Lichterkette Garten") and is what CCU programs and automations
 * typically address.
 *
 * The paired `SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER` is re-typed to `SWITCH` before being returned so that
 * `wireChannelEndpoint` and `mapSwitchChannel` can process it with the standard switch logic.
 *
 * The device is always mains-powered; `batteryPowered` is forced to `false` regardless of
 * what the discovery layer inferred.
 *
 * The per-channel `switchMatterType` option (from user overrides) is respected so that
 * individual outputs can still be exposed as `'light'`, `'outlet'`, or `'switch'`.
 *
 * > **Note — also works without this mapper:** `resolveChannelsForMatter` already pairs each
 * > `SWITCH_TRANSMITTER` with the first `SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER` that follows it and
 * > re-types it to `'SWITCH'`, so the generic channel-mapper loop would produce one
 * > independent switch endpoint per output on its own. This device mapper therefore serves
 * > primarily as the **canonical example of the multi-endpoint pattern** (returning more than
 * > one `MappedDeviceEndpoint` per device) and to make the transmitter→receiver pairing logic
 * > explicit and testable in isolation.
